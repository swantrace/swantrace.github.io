# Hello Hono!

Welcome to my personal portfolio and blog built with **Bun**, **Hono**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS v4**.

This is my first blog post demonstrating the static site generation capabilities of this setup.

## What this project includes:

- **Fast runtime** with Bun
- **Modern web framework** with Hono
- **Static site generation** with Vite SSG
- **Styling** with Tailwind CSS v4
- **Markdown support** for blog posts
- **TypeScript** for type safety

Stay tuned for more posts!
